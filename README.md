# Route-Planner
Implementation of a simulation-based route planning system for RESCUE 1122 ambulance service in Lahore. This system utilizes a grid-based map representation with obstacles and road infrastructure, aiming to find the optimal path from the ambulance's start location to the accident site, considering shortest-distance criteria. This Repository consists of two different implementations of route planner. The first approach uses A Star Search algorithm while the second one utilizes Genetic Algorithm. Both of these algorithms are implemented in C++.
